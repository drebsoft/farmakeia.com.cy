## About Farmakeia.com.cy

Farmakeia.com.cy is a webapp that allows its users to quickly find a list of and details about all the previous, current, or future on-call pharmacies across Cyprus. It includes a lot of cool features, such as:

- The ability to search for pharmacies by region
- The ability to filter a region's pharmacy by name or address
- The ability to view the phone, address, future on-call shifts for a pharmacy
- The ability to view each pharmacy's location on a map powered by Google Maps or
- The ability to view all pharmacies in our database in a single interactive map, powered again by Google Maps

All the information on the site comes from parsing the official lists of pharmacies that the Cypriot Ministry of Health makes available online.
